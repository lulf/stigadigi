# stigadigi

Stigadigi is the software for a stiga table hockey game. The software is split into a firmware part
and a backend part.

The firmware part runs on a microcontoller connected to sensors mounted on the
table hockey board. The firmware will eventually be able to forward data to the backend.

The bakend part can run anywhere on the internet, but it is not yet finished.
